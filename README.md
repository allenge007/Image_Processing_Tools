## Introduction

This repository provides various tools to perform image processing operations such as filtering, transformation, and analysis.

## Features

- Image filtering (e.g., Gaussian, Median)
- Image transformation (e.g., Rotation, Scaling)
- Image analysis (e.g., Edge detection, Histogram analysis)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use the tools:

### Filtering

```python
from tools import filter_image

filtered_image = filter_image(input_image, method='gaussian')
```

### Transformation

```python
from tools import transform_image

transformed_image = transform_image(input_image, method='rotate', angle=90)
```

### Analysis

```python
from tools import analyze_image

edges = analyze_image(input_image, method='edge_detection')
```
